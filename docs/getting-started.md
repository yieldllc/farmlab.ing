# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up your first small-scale farming operation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- Access to outdoor space (even a balcony works!)
- Basic gardening tools
- Enthusiasm to learn!

## Step 1: Assess Your Space

You have several options for farming spaces:

### Option A: Container Gardening

The most accessible option. Great for:

- Balconies and patios

A step up that provides:

For those with more space:

- Traditional row gardens
- Permaculture food forests
- Market garden layouts

!!! warning "Sunlight Requirements"
    Most vegetables need 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. Assess your space before planting!

## Step 2: Test and Build Your Soil

We recommend starting with:

```bash
# Key soil amendments to consider

```
